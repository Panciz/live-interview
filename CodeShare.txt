/**


The application store the workers of an Hospital departement and provide some report such the as list of doctors by name or by salaries.
There are different type of workers (Nurses, Technician, Chirurgical Doctors, Doctors), for each worker there is a different way to calculate the salary.
For example the Chirurgical Doctors has no extra time but they have a bonus for each operation, the nurses has nights hours.

The application should be able also to send a general alert to call some case of worker in case of emergency. 
In this case Technician and  Chirurgical Doctors should be allert. 



Add the missing code that allows the main to run.
