/**


The application must calculate the total costs of an hospital department as the total sum of the employee salaries.
There are different type of workers (Nurses, Auxiliary, Director, Doctors....), for each worker there is a different way to calculate the salary.

1. Add the missing code that allows the main to run. 
2. Imagine to add a different type of worker
3. Use Stream features to calculate the department
