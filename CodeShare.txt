/**


The application must calculate the total cost of an hospital as total sum of the cost centers that  contains.


The cost centers can be departments or independent workers (For example independent doctor that are not related to a specific department )

Each department can contains different workers.

There are different type of workers (Nurses, Auxiliary, Director, Doctors....), for each worker there is a different way to calculate the salary.
For example the director has no extra time but there is the bonus, the nurses has nights hours, etc...


Add the missing code that allows the main to run!
